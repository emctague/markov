Markov Chain Processor

This is a simple JavaScript web utility.
It takes in a string of plain text (or space-separated items) and generates
a new, randomized string based on the given input.

If the markov chain is unable to generate a string of the required length
using the given input, it will become stuck in an infinite loop - simply
refresh the page and correct your input.
